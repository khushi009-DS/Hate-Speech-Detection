# Hate-Speech-Detection
# Hate Speech Detection Using Machine Learning  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project aims to identify and classify hate speech in text data using machine learning models. It was developed to understand text classification techniques and deploy a real-time prediction system using Flask.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- Detects offensive and non-offensive text in user inputs  
- Flask web application for real-time predictions  
- High accuracy with Logistic Regression (94%)  
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction  

## 📊 Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib  
- **Web Framework:** Flask  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  

## 📈 Performance Metrics  
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 94% | 0.92 | 0.93 | 0.92 |
| Decision Tree | 88% | 0.87 | 0.88 | 0.87 |
| Random Forest | 90% | 0.89 | 0.90 | 0.89 |  

## 🔍 Insights  
- **Logistic Regression performed best** for this dataset due to its robustness on small datasets.
- Addressing **data imbalance** was crucial for better predictions.
- **Feature engineering techniques** (e.g., removing stopwords, vectorization) significantly improved model accuracy
